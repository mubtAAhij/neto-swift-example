# Localization

This directory contains localization files for the application.

## Structure
- Each locale has its own `.lproj` directory (e.g., `en.lproj`, `es.lproj`)
- Each `.lproj` directory contains:
  - `Localizable.strings`: The main localization file
  - `README.md`: Documentation for that locale

## Supported Locales
- en-US
- es-419
- zh-CN
- fr-FR

## Usage
See the README.md in each .lproj directory for usage instructions.

## Maintenance
These files are automatically generated and maintained by Quetzal.
Do not edit them manually as your changes will be overwritten.
